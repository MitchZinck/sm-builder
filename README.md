# SM Builder

The goal of this project is to build a collection of content specific social accounts (think 100+). Nobody has time to manage and curate content for 100+ social media accounts so the goal of this project is to fix that.

Currently the project supports grabbing content from Reddit, storing it and then posting it to Instagram. An example account is @everythingawwww on Instagram. This account gets the top 10 posts from /r/aww over a period of 24 hours, posts and then repeats.
Social media accounts can post content from either a single subreddit or a mixture of subreddits.
